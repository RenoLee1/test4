# Implementation steps (Workflow)
1. Select topic (15 mins)
    - Decision: Fitness-oriented Recipe and Meal Planning Application
    - Reason: More interesing than the other
2. Clarify project requirements (1 hr 30mins)
    - Discuss with client
    - Record requirements
    - Still leave some question (*)
        - Plan to discuss on Monday tutorial
3. Roles and responsibilities distribution
    - Jingcheng Liu: Scrum Master and full-stack developer.
4. Select a development framework (1 hour)
    - Orininal Decision: React Native + Node.js
        - Reason: React Native allows using the same codebase to develop applications that work on both iOS and Android platforms, enabling cross-platform development. This significantly reduces development time and maintenance costs.Additionally, React Native possesses an abundant component library, which can accelerate the development process.Moreover, React Native has a vast developer community, which aids in problem-solving during development.For Node.js, this enables both frontend and backend development to use the same language, which is JavaScript, reducing the learning cost.Simultaneously, Node.js also has a rich community and ecosystem.Finally, Node.js can develop both websites and applications, allowing us to learn one technology and apply it to two different types of development work.
    - Final Decision: Expo + Node.js
        - Reason: React Native is a little bit hard to familiarize quickly as a beginner. After our learning and research, we found that Expo is a more direct and simplified implementation approach. It's a platform based on React Native, but it significantly reduces the complexity of the workflow while enhancing the functionality of React Native. Of course, choosing Expo also comes with some drawbacks, as it is a relatively new technology. Online educational resources are limited, so we need to directly study Expo's official documentation, which might require more time in this aspect.
5.  Get started with a simple demo
    - using Expo based on the official documentation
